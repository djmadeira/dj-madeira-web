## Life
I was born in Trucksville, Pennsylvania to David &amp; Melanie Madeira. I played outside for a bit, but then I discovered video games, and that was the end of that.

When I was 14, I got an internship at a newspaper ad production company, where I worked on their first website.

In 2011, I got an internship at Infinity Concepts, a branding agency in Export, Pennsylvania, where I worked on a few web-related projects and got to see how a traditional agency works.

In 2012, I started working at Live Mercury, a branding and creative services agency in Dallas, Pennsylvania.

I currently live in Arlington, Virginia.

## Work

I currently work at Opower in Arlington, VA. The short answer is that we make cloud services for utility companies. The long answer is long, and full of terrors. I'll add this when I'm not frantically porting my blog over.

By any other time of day, I like to work on side projects (With a particular interest in Node.js). You can see some of the projects I've completed on my projects page (coming soon).

# Hobbies

I love reading and writing, but I don't do either as often as I should. Speculative science fiction short stories are a particular passion (Philip K Dick, Isaac Asimov, Greg Egan), but I enjoy novels as well (Lord of The Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, Hitchhiker's Guide) and books about programming (JavaScript: The Good Parts).

I love video games, and I do it *more* than I should. My favorites include Spelunky, XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, Deus Ex & DE: Human Revolution, Dishonored, Batman: Arkham Asylum/City, Half-Life 2, and The Walking Dead.

I have an interest in making games, but at present I haven't completed a game project. *I hope to rectify this soon.* I have made a few terrible games unfit for release. Yay!

I also play board and card games, primarily Android: Netrunner.
