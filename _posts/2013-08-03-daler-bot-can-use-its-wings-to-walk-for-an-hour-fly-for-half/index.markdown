<blockquote>Most robots only use one type of locomotion. They fly through the air (raining death from above, in the case of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/20/un-afghanistan-drone-deaths">US military drones</a>), swim through the seas, like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/19/sharkbot">Sharkbot</a>&nbsp;or this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/31/robot-jellyfish">robotic jellyfish</a>, or<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/12/start/these-bots-are-made-for-walking">crawl</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-10/31/headless-robot-warrior">run</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/30/kids-mech-suit">roll</a>&nbsp;across the earth.

However, the Daler&mdash;<a href="http://actu.epfl.ch/news/latest-video-of-the-daler-project-shows-a-walkin-2/">Deployable air land exploration robot</a>&mdash;uses "adaptive morphology" to master the skies and the earth. It has a wingspan of 60cm, and using its battery-powered "Whegs"&mdash;wheel-legs&mdash;can fly for 30 minutes or walk for an hour</blockquote>

I bet in the next few years we're going to see a quantum leap in battery technology- whether it comes from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/lithium-air-battery-advance-could-be-jaw-dropping-improvement-over-li-ion/">lithium air</a> or something else, our technology is being hamstrung by our limited ability to cram a lot of energy in a small space. Somebody will figure this out, and when they do it'll open up a ton of possibilities, from <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-31747_7-57596794-243/what-the-next-ipad-mini-can-learn-from-the-nexus-7/">smaller devices with more pixels</a> to search &amp; rescue robots that we can actually use.
