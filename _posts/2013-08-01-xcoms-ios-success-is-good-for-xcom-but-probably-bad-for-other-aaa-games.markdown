The initially great <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-07-30-xcom-proves-USD20-apps-can-work-says-take-two-ceo">news that XCOM was a commercial success on mobile</a> has a dark flipside; on one hand, it proves people will pay for good games. On the other hand, this last paragraph worries me:

<blockquote>Take-Two has previously experimented with bringing some of its AAA efforts to mobile platforms, most notably with older titles like Max Payne and Grand Theft Auto III. But with tablet horsepower beginning to catch up, Zelnick has said before he hopes to have mobile versions of AAA titles arrive simultaneously with their console or PC counterparts.</blockquote>

Games usually suffer when they're made for the lowest common denominator. My fear is, games will start to be designed around working on a tablet rather than being great PC experiences/vice versa. Tablets work well for XCOM, but they don't for a lot of other types of games. We'll see.
