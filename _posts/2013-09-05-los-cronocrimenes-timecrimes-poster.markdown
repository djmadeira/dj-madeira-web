<a href="http://djmadeira.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/timecrimes.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-248" src="http://djmadeira.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/timecrimes-235x300.png" alt="timecrimes" width="235" height="300" /></a>I recently watched the Spanish film Timecrimes (<strong>what was the localization guy thinking when he typed up that title?</strong>), and I was inspired to make a movie poster based on the 3 objects that represented major plot points in the film. If you haven't seen it, these three objects basically symbolize the three acts of the film. It's a very good time-travel film, and I do recommend it. If you enjoyed <em>The Prestige</em> or <em>Memento </em>(also both <strong>very</strong> good films,) you'll like this movie.

If you haven't seen the movie, well, at least it's some pretty good vector art. You can download and explore the Ai doc <a href="http://sitesahoy.com/misc/timecrimes.ai">here</a>. Use it for your own purposes if you like, but don't pass it off as your own, please.
