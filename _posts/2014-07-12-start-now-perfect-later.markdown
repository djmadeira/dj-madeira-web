I finally redid my website. I took 2, 6 hour marathon coding sessions and just hammered it out. It's not perfect, but I can iterate on it. The hardest part was just doing it without first trying to do all the things I wanted to have in it in the first version.

There are quite a few things I like about this site. I like the extremely simple captcha mechanism (only time will tell whether it actually works). I like how it works without JS. I like&nbsp;that it puts the content first. I like that it's pretty fast (~2s load time,&nbsp;with way too much of that being server response time).

There are things I don't like. The categories need to be renamed and sorted more specifically. The about page needs to be rewritten. There are some layout things at mobile width that need addressing. But I can fix those things&nbsp;one at a time, and I'm going to have a lot of fun doing it. Something that I didn't realize when I was trying to redo my website perfectly the first time is that I'm enjoying tweaking things, and I think I'll continue to enjoy it.

So yea. You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again. Start. Don't get bogged down on making it perfect, even if that first version will be embarrassing; because at least it's <em>your</em> embarrassing, not some theme that's bloated and slow in addition to being ugly and not&nbsp;representing your personality.
