This was submitted to thinkgeek for their bounty program; but I suspect it's probably too close to copyright infringement for them to be able to use. And after I did it, I looked it up and there are actually already <a href="http://www.stylinonline.com/t-shirt-portal-2-lemon-grenade-text-shr.html?Size=XX-Large&amp;gclid=CNmN1tSh9rkCFcOj4AodNFsAOw">better versions</a> of this out there. But I'm still proud of it.
