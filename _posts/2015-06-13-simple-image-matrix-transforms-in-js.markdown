After reading <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/26/why-the-svg-filter-is-awesome/">this excellent post</a> about advanced SVG filters, I wanted to understand more about <a href="http://graficaobscura.com/matrix/index.html">matrix transforms</a>, because they sounded interesting and because learning is fun! The only way for me to really understand something is to write it in code, so I made an implementation in the easiest runtime environment around at this point, the browser.

If you are also the kind of person who has to see it in code to understand, this might prove useful to you. I've uploaded the tiny project to <a href="https://github.com/djmadeira/JSMatrixTransform.git">GitHub</a>. The demo is available <a href="https://djmadeira.github.io/JSMatrixTransform/">here</a>.

Let me know if this is helpful to you by shooting me a tweet or leaving a comment!
