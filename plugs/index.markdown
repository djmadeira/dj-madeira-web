<p>Here's some things I think are awesome and you should totes check out. (note: this isn't an inclusive list of everything I think is awesome; just stuff that needs more love than it gets)</p>
<h2>Software (all OSX/Unix only)</h2>
<a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>&nbsp;- image editor, not too expensive, clean and simple, gets most of the job done (though if you're making web images you should run them through something like Grunt before publishing.) You'll need something else for SVG, though; I like <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>, but I don't know that I'd necessarily recommend it as it often falls short of what I want.</p>
<p><a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> - I don't think I could calculate how much time dash has saved me. Makes the usually annoying task of searching docs fast and fun.</p>
<p><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> - webkit-based editor! So trendy! I like to roll the packages&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/abe33/atom-color-highlight">atom-color-highlight</a>, <a href="https://github.com/saschagehlich/autocomplete-plus">autocomplete-plus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/saschagehlich/autocomplete-paths">autocomplete-paths</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons">file-icons</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> - please, please use a password manager. It'll make everyone's life easier, especially yours. 1Password is totes the bestest.</p>
<p><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>&nbsp;- open source workflow automation; like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, but more programatic and less JSON-y. I like it. Performance advantage is moot, frankly.</p>
<p><a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> - great RSS&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast.fm</a> - smart. speed. I am like a&nbsp;that guy from alphas that moves super fast because of his metabolism thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a>, <a href="http://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12">Flycut</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;- totally awesome&nbsp;utilities.</p>
<p>And I'm also reverse-plugging Skype. It's just, ugh, it's the worst. Seriously, most <em>whales</em> design better interfaces. In their <em>sleep</em>.</p>
<h2>Comics</h2>
<a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a> -&nbsp;dark, academic, daily</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php">Dinosaur comics</a> - light, goofy, nerdy, almost daily</p>
<p><a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/">Awkward Zombie</a> - awwwwwkwaaaaaard. No, it's great.</p>

<p><span style="color: #292f33;"><a href="https://twitter.com/mode7games">Paul Kilduff-Taylor</a> - creator of Frozen Synapse. Delightful indie man. Brit.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kirkhamilton">Kirk Hamilton</a> - lover of music and games, consistently amiable and cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/c_pruett">Chris Pruett</a>&nbsp;- just a regular indie developer&nbsp;who&nbsp;wrote <a href="http://www.dreamdawn.com/sh/">an entire website about horror games</a>. Very cool guy.</p>

<p><a href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/">incompetech.com</a> - so much royalty-free music my brain hurts.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
Every single one of these is games you should pay money for and play because they are all wonderful and super the best:</p>
<p><a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/">Kentucky Route Zero</a> - this game isn't even done yet, and already it's one of my favorite games. <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/01/11/wot-i-think-kentucky-route-zero-act-i/">Read this</a>. If you aren't sure if this is your thing, <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/the-entertainment/">play this first</a>. Play it anyway; it's also awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stanleyparable.com/">The Stanley Parable</a> - please give this man all the money so he can keep making dumb crap like this. Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelloCakebread">he stopped tweeting</a>, which is so sad.</p>
<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<a href="http://onvg.libsyn.com/">Oh No! Video games!</a>&nbsp;- a podcast about... video games. Their Patreon promos are the best thing. They also sometimes talk about netrunner.</p>
<p><a href="http://mollyrocket.com/376">The Jeff and Casey Show</a> - a show ostensibly about... um... a show put on by programmers about... stuff. Never really cover any topics. They spent an hour and 30 minutes summarizing Transformers 4. So yea. It's great.</p>
